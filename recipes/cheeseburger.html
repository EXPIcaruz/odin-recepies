<h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Easy Cheddar Cheeseburgers made with ground beef, cheddar cheese & an amazing blend of seasonings! Fire up the grill and make the best homemade cheeseburgers ever!
Cheeseburgers are a delicious, lip smacking summertime BBQ staple at my house. With only four ingredients, this cheeseburger recipe is quick, easy and flavorful.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>

<li>1 lb ground beef</li>
<li>bbq seasoning</li>
<li>4 slices of cheedar cheese</li>
<li>4 burger buns </li>
<li>Conidments/Toppings</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Pre heat your grill to medium-high to high heat, around 375 to 400 degrees F.</li>
    <li>Hand mix the ground beef, BBQ rub and shredded cheese in a mixing bowl. Divide the hamburger into 3-4 equal sizes, depending on how big you want your patties. Roll the meat into a ball and flatten to make the patties. For best results, make the patties about the same diameter as your hamburger bun. Use a 1 tsp measuring spoon or your thumb to make a 1/4"-1/2" indentation in the center of each patty.
    </li>
    <li>Place the patties on the grill, over direct heat. Flip when they no longer stick to the grill, approximately 5 minutes per side.</li>
    <li>approximately 5 minutes per side.
        When the burgers are done cooking, place a slice of cheese on each patty and let sit on the grill, over indirect heat, for no more than a minute.</li>
    <li>Once the sliced cheese is slightly melted, remove the burgers from the grill and serve immediately on a bun with your favorite toppings/condiments.  Enjoy!!</li>
