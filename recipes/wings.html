    <h2>A plate of buffalo wings</h2>

  
  <p>A popular bar food and appetizer, wings can be ordered mild or spicy, and boneless varieties are also common. The name comes from Buffalo, New York, where the dish was created.</p>

 <h3>Ingredients</h3>
 <ul>
    <li>2 lb. chicken wings</li>
    <li>2 tbsp. vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1sp garlic powder</li>
    <li>Kosher Salt</li>
    <li>hot sauce</li>
    <li>honey</li>
    <li>butter</li>
    

 </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400° and place a wire rack over a baking sheet. In a large bowl, toss chicken wings with oil and season with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Transfer to prepared baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake until chicken is golden and skin is crispy, 50 to 60 minutes, flipping the wings halfway through.</li>
    <li>In a small saucepan, whisk together hot sauce and honey. Bring to simmer then stir in butter. Cook until butter is melted and slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Heat broiler on low. Transfer baked wings to a bowl and toss with buffalo sauce until completely coated. Return wings to rack and broil—watching carefully!—until sauce caramelizes, 3 minutes. Serve with ranch dressing and vegetables.</li>
</ol>
